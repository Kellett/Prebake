Using this list isn't recommended but is provided\r\nfor completeness. Simple two- or three-word links to privacy pages\r\naren't blocked (such as links in a page footer), but a lengthy\r\nparagraph mid-page will be.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nThere are going to be sites that I have missed, or I may have just\r\nscrewed up with a CSS selector. In any case, feel free to point out\r\nbugs or request new sites to be added via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/liamja/Prebake/issues),\r\nor submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n## User Agreement\r\n\r\nBy using these filters, you are accepting and allowing sites to\r\nset cookies by default. You agree to allow the sites you visit to\r\nset cookies.\r\n\r\nOnly use these filters if you understand the implications of\r\nallowing cookies."}
